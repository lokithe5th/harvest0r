# Harvest0r

The HarvestorFactory contract allows users to deploy Harvestors for specific tokens using `newHarvestor`.

These harvestors allow users to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting by making a market
for the specified token and buying it at a constant price of 0.069 ether.

The Seeds Access Voucher NFTs (SEEDS) are required to allow access to Harvestor Contracts.
The Seeds NFTs hold 9 charges, which grants access to the `sellToken` functionality 9 times.

Once depleted the NFT can be recharged through the `recharge` function of the `Seeds.sol` contract.

This project was created as part of the BuidlGuidl and is built on Scaffold-eth

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

🚨 If you are using a version < v18 you will need to remove `openssl-legacy-provider` from the `start` script in `package.json`

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
